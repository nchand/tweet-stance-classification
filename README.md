# tweet-stance-classification

Stance classification is a subcategory of opinion mining, where the task is to automatically determine whether the author of a piece of text is in favour or against a given target.Automatically detecting stance has widespread applications in information retrieval, text summarization, and textual entailment. 

This  project  is  to  develop  a  Deep  learning  model  to  classify  tweets  that  are  about one of five politically-charged targets:  “Atheism”, “the Feminist Movement”, “ClimateChange  is  a  Real  Concern”,  “Legalization  of  Abortion”,  or  “Hillary  Clinton”.   Giventhe text of a tweet and a target, models must classify the tweet as either FAVOUR orAGAINST,  or  NEITHER  (if  the  tweet  does  not  express  support  or  opposition  to  thetarget  topic). 

The  data  set,  contains  a  collection  of  2,814  training  and  1,249  test  set tweets. The original dataset is from “Semeval-2016 Task 6:  Detecting Stance in Tweets. Saif M. Mohammad et.  al.  In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-16).  June 2016.”
